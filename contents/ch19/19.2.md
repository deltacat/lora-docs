### 19.2 Downlink Diagram for Confirmed Data Messages

The following diagram illustrates the basic sequence of a “confirmed” downlink.

The frame exchange is initiated by the end-device transmitting an “unconfirmed” application payload or any other frame on channel A. The network uses the downlink receive window to transmit a “confirmed” data frame towards the end-device on the same channel A. Upon reception of this data frame requiring an acknowledgement, the end-device transmits a frame with the ACK bit set at its own discretion. This frame might also contain piggybacked data or MAC commands as its payload. This ACK uplink is treated like any standard uplink, and as such is transmitted on a random channel that might be different from channel A.

>Note: To allow the end-devices to be as simple as possible and have keep as few states as possible it may transmit an explicit (possibly empty) acknowledgement data message immediately after the reception of a data message requiring an acknowledgment. Alternatively the end-device may defer the transmission of an acknowledgement to piggyback it with its next data message.
