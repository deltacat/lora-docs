### 19.1 Uplink Timing Diagram for Confirmed Data Messages

The following diagram illustrates the steps followed by an end-device trying to transmit two confirmed data frames (Data0 and Data1). This deviceâ€™s NbTrans parameter must be greater or equal to 2 for this example to be valid (because the first confirmed frame is transmitted twice)

The end-device first transmits a confirmed data frame containing the Data0 payload at an arbitrary instant and on an arbitrary channel. The frame counter Cu is simply derived by adding 1 to the previous uplink frame counter. The network receives the frame and generates a downlink frame with the ACK bit set exactly RECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds later, using the first receive window of the end-device. This downlink frame uses the same data rate and the same channel as the Data0 uplink. The downlink frame counter Cd is also derived by adding 1 to the last downlink towards that specific end-device. If there is no downlink payload pending the network shall generate a frame without a payload. In this example the frame carrying the ACK bit is not received.

If an end-device does not receive a frame with the ACK bit set in one of the two receive windows immediately following the uplink transmission it may resend the same frame with the same payload and frame counter again at least ACK_TIMEOUT seconds after the second reception window. This resend must be done on another channel and must obey the duty cycle limitation as any other normal transmission. If this time the end-device receives the ACK downlink during its first receive window, as soon as the ACK frame is demodulated, the end-device is free to transmit a new frame on a new channel.

The third ACK frame in this example also carries an application payload. A downlink frame can carry any combination of ACK, MAC control commands and payload.
