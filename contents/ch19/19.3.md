### Downlink Timing for Frame-Pending Messages

The next diagram illustrates the use of the **frame pending** (FPending) bit on a downlink. The FPending bit can only be set on a downlink frame and informs the end-device that the network has several frames pending for him; the bit is ignored for all uplink frames.

If a frame with the FPending bit set requires an acknowledgement, the end-device shall do so as described before. If no acknowledgment is required, the end-device may send an empty data message to open additional receive windows at its own discretion, or wait until it has some data to transmit itself and open receive windows as usual.

>Note: The FPending bit is independent to the acknowledgment scheme.

(*) F_P means ‘frame pending’ bit set

In this example the network has two confirmed data frames to transmit to the end-device. The frame exchange is initiated by the end-device via a normal “unconfirmed” uplink message on channel A. The network uses the first receive window to transmit the Data0 with the bit FPending set as a confirmed data message. The device acknowledges the reception of the frame by transmitting back an empty frame with the ACK bit set on a new channel B. RECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds later, the network transmits the second frame Data1 on channel B, again using a confirmed data message but with the FPending bit cleared. The end-device acknowledges on channel C.

In this example, the downlink frames are “unconfirmed” frames, the end-device does not need to send back and acknowledge. Receiving the Data0 unconfirmed frame with the FPending bit set the end-device sends an empty data frame. This first uplink is not received by the network. If no downlink is received during the two receive windows, the network has to wait for the next spontaneous uplink of the end-device to retry the transfer. The end-device can speed up the procedure by sending a new empty data frame.

>Note: An acknowledgement is never sent twice.


The FPending bit, the ACK bit, and payload data can all be present in the same downlink. For example, the following frame exchange is perfectly valid.

The end-device sends a “confirmed data” uplink. The network can answer with a confirmed downlink containing Data + ACK + “Frame pending” then the exchange continues as previously described.
