### 22.4 Revision 1.1 

This section provides an overview of the main changes happening between LoRaWAN1.1 and LoRaWAN1.0.2.

#### 22.4.1 Clarifications

- Grammatical
- Normative text used consistently
- ADR behavior, 
    - Introduced the concept of ADR command block processing 
    - TXPower handling 
    - Default channel re-enabling 
    - ADR Backoff behavior
- Default TXPower definition
- FCnt shall never be reused with the same session keys
- MAC Commands are discarded if present in both FOpts and Payload
- Retransmission backoff clarification

#### 22.4.2 Functional modifications


- FCnt changes 
    - All counters are 32bits wide, 16bits not supported any more 
    - Separation of FCntDown into AFCntDown and NFCntDown
        - Remove state synchronization requirement from NS/AS 
    - Remove requirement to discard frames if FCnt gap is greater than MAX_FCNT_GAP
        - Unnecessary with 32bit counters 
    - End-device Frame counters are reset upon the successful processing of a Join-Accep
    - ABP device must never reset frame counters
- Retransmission (transmission without incrementing the FCnt)
    - Downlink frames are never retransmitted 
    - Subsequent receptions of a frame with the same FCnt are ignored 
    - Uplink retransmissions are controlled by NbTrans (this includes both confirmed and unconfirmed frames)
    - A retransmission may not occur until both RX1 and RX2 receive windows have expired 
    - Class B/C devices cease retransmitting a frame upon the reception of a frame in the RX1 window
    - Class A device cease retransmitting a frame upon the reception of a frame in either the RX1 or RX2 window
- Key changes
    - Added one new root key (separation of cipher function) 
        - NwkKey and AppKey
    - Added new session keys
        - NwkSEncKey encrypts payloads where Fport = 0 (MAC command payload)
        - AppSKey encrypts payloads where Fport != 0 (Application payloads) 
        - NwkSIntKey is used to MIC downlink frames
            - For downlinks with the ACK bit set, the 2 LSBs of the AFCntUp of the confirmed uplink which generated the ACK are added to the MIC calculation
    - SNwkSIntKey and FNwkSIntKey are used to MIC uplink frames
        - Each is used to calculate 2 separate 16 bit MICs which are combined to a single 32 bit MIC
        - The SNwkSIntKey portion is considered "private" and not shared with a roaming fNs
        - The FNwkSIntKey portion is considered "public" and may be shared with a roaming fNs
        - The private MIC portion now uses the TxDr, TxCh
        - For uplinks with the ACK bit set, the 2 LSBs of the FCntDown of the confirmed downlink which generated the ACK are added to the private MIC calculation
    - Keys fully defined later (section 6)
    - Associated MIC and Encrypt changes using new keys
- MAC Commands introduced
    - TxParamSetupReq/Ans
    - DlChannelReq/Ans
    - ResetInd/Conf
    - ADRParamSetupReq/Ans
    - DeviceTimeReq/Ans
    - ForceRejoinReq
    - RejoinParamSetupReq/Ans
    - For the linkADRReq command
        - Value of 0xF is to be ignored for DR or TXPower
        - Value of 0 is to be ignored for NbTrans
- Activation
    - JoinEUI replaces AppEUI (clarification)
    - EUI's fully defined
    - Root keys defined
        - NwkKey
        - AppKey
    - Additional session keys added (split MIC/Encrypt keys)
        - SNwkSIntKeyUp and FNwkSIntKeyUp (split-MIC uplink)
        - NwkSIntKeyDown (MIC downlink)
        - NwkSEncKey (Encrypt up/down)
        - JSIntKey (Rejoin-Request and related Join-Accept)
        - JSencKey (Join-Accepts in response to Rejoin-Request)
    - Session context defined
- OTAA
    - JoinAccept MIC modified to prevent replay attack
    - Session key derivation defined
    - ReJoin-Request messages defined (one new LoRaWAN Message type [MType]
        - 0 - Handover roaming assist
        - 1 - Backend state recovery assist
        - 2 - Rekey session keys
    - All Nonces are now counters (not random any more)
    - NetId clarified (association with Home Network)
    - OptNeg bit defined in Join-Accept to identify 1.0 or 1.1+ operational version of network backend
        - 1.0 operation reversion by a 1.1 device defined 
- ABP
    - Additional Session key requirement described
- Class B
    - Network now controls the deviceâ€™s DR
    - Beacon definition moved to Regional document
    - Clarifications
    - Deprecated the BeaconTimingReq/Ans (replaced by the standard MAC command DeviceTimeReq/Ans) 
- Class C
    - Clarify requirement for a DL timeout
    - Add Class C MAC Commands
        - DeviceModeInd/Conf
