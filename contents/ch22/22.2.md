### 22.2 Revision 1.0.1

- Clarified the RX window start time definition
- Corrected the maximum payload size for DR2 in the NA section
- Corrected the typo on the downlink data rate range in 7.2.2
- Introduced a requirement for using coding rate 4/5 in 7.2.2 to guarantee a maximum time on air < 400mSec
- Corrected the Join-accept MIC calculation in 6.2.5
- Clarified the NbRep field and renamed it to NbTrans in 5.2
- Removed the possibility to not encrypt the Applicative payload in the MAC layer, removed the paragraph 4.3.3.2. If further security is required by the application, the payload will be encrypted, using any method, at the application layer then re-encrypted at the MAC layer using the specified default LoRaWAN encryption
- Corrected FHDR field size typo
- Corrected the channels impacted by ChMask when chMaskCntl equals 6 or 7 in 7.2.5
- Clarified 6.2.5 sentence describing the RX1 slot data rate offset in the JoinResp message
- Removed the second half of the DRoffset table in 7.2.7 , as DR>4 will never be used for uplinks by definition
- Removed explicit duty cycle limitation implementation in the EU868Mhz ISM band (chapter7.1)
- Made the RXtimingSetupAns and RXParamSetupAns sticky MAC commands to avoid end-deviceâ€™s hidden state problem. (in 5.4 and 5.7)
- Added a frequency plan for the Chinese 470-510MHz metering band
- Added a frequency plan for the Australian 915-928MHz ISM band
